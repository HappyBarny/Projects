Thats my project for my java exam based on Conways game of Life.
You have 3 different charcaters (C1, C2, C3) and all of them, every round, can only move randomically inside the matrix.
Every characters have HP point and every time a character meet another character, he acquires new hp points but that not always happens.
The matrix doesnt have boundries.
